Damn!

I will use this space to write about many many things. Probably next few days/months (2019 Feb now), I will focus on science, but definitely drift to talk about spirituality!

About me: Nicknames are Vissu / Vish and Fish (these days by my cordial friends)

My gurus: many!

This is awesome - Feb 20, 2019 / Debt: Close to $$$$$K / Married $$ / Visited many places / Perfect time in my life to start writing about what I learnt from my own self and especially from my science gurus!!
