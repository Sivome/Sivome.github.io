# Greetings!   

My educational background is in engineering, then went into life sciences domain to do some fun stuff (using simulations, models, lot of cluster computing) and wanted to share some of the projects I worked on, hence this space! This also helps me advertise the work I do.

I like data and I like biology. Over the last few years, there is an exponential rise in availability of high-dimensional biological datasets, thanks to open-source efforts. This allowed me to easily access a data set from a publicly available repository, come up with a research problem, write scripts to analyze/visualize towards reaching the goal of understanding the data a bit more!

Topics, I'm interested:  
Proteomics  
Genomics  
Systems biology  
Molecular dynamics simulations  


For most of this, I use Python / R.  

Some of the Python modules I use often are numpy, pandas scipy, scikit-learn, keras, matplotlib.  

Likewise, some of the R packages I use are dplyr, tidyr, purr, ggplot2, cowplot.  

If you're interested to know more, refer to my [CV](/cv) or go through the [blog posts](/).
