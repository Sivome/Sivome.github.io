## Ola!
### Namaste!

Given my interests in -omics technologies, and large-scale data analyses, I started using lot of Python / R for my work. Sometimes, I need to go back and re-use some of the scripts I created. To keep the search process easier for myself, I created this space.

Some of the topics I'm interested are:
Proteomics
Genomics
Systems biology w.r.t metabolic network models

Personally I see the data coming from the above technologies as some kind of numbers/patterns and to analyze such patterns, I find some of the below tools very helpful!

Python modules such as numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, keras, for data-analysis (keras with theano/tf for deep learning as well!)
and modules like matplot lib for visualization

R packages like dplyr, plyr in the tidyverse domain for data-analysis
and packages like ggplot2, cowplot for visualization

If you're interested in some of the work I did in the past and the kind of work I'm currently doing, please refer to my [CV](https://sivome.github.io/cv/)

By the way, I'm Vish! :-)
