I created this space to adverstise about what kind of contract work I typically do. However, to make it more interesting, i add sample scripts in the form of a blog a.k.a scientificoProgrammoBlog where I will mix scripts (mostly Python modules and ocassionaly R packages) and a topic in bioinformatics such as Systems biology with methods such as flux balance analyses, genomics, proteomics etc.

I write here whenever Iâ€™ve time and hope I find this blog helpful both to students and serious researchers and programmers in big data, including science and engineering.
