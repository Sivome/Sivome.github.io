Over the last few years, there is an exponential rise in availability of high-dimensional biological datasets, thanks to open-source efforts. Two technologies that generate such high-dimensional data sets are:
[1]. Next-generation sequencing [NGS] based genomics/transcriptomics technologies, 
[2]. Mass-spectrometry based proteomics/phosphoproteomics technologies. 

Sivome's interests lie at developing cloud-based, bioinformatics pipeline technologies for NGS as well as mass-spectrometry based technologies.
