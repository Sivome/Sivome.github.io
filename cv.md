### RESEARCH INTERESTS

I am a computational scientist with heavy math, modeling and simulation experience in engineering and life sciences domain. Post-PHD, I have 12+ years’ experience in analyzing high-throughput –molecular data including, next-generation sequencing based genomics/transcriptomics as well as mass-spectrometry based proteomics/metabolomics data. Recently, my focus is on using deep learning methods to analyze the high-dimensional -omics data to infer associations in the data.

Till date, my research work has resulted in ~20 peer-reviewed publications and numerous conference proceedings and poster presentations (google scholar citations: ~580, h-index=11).

    a. Developed a new method (proof-of-principle) for PTM annotation on genomes (NCBI RefSeq) by using high-throughput proteomics data (PhosphoSite, PhosphoELM) and domain definitions of protein families within NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD).  
    b. Apart from the large-scale annotation of conserved PTM sites on genomes, this method could facilitate identification of novel evolutionarily conserved posttranslational modifications.  

 • Developed a prototype for new class of peptide identification search algorithm OMSSA-SIM.  
    a. Motivation is to remove most of the limitations faced by present generation sequence library search algorithms, for example, exact precursor mass match, unknown PTM’s, mutations, different enzymatic cleavage etc.
